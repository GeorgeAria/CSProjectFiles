# Client/Server programs
For this project, my partner and I were tasked with creating a Server and Client program that implemented a very simple application level protocol. We used the Socket IO library in Java in order to accomplish this.
You must run the Server program before you run the Client program.
You are then given the option to type 4 commands:
1. UPPERCASE
2. LOWERCASE
3. REVERSE
4. EXIT

UPPERCASE: Type in a word, press ENTER and then type "." and ENTER. The server will return your word with all the letters capitalized.
Example: "hello" becomes "HELLO"

LOWERCASE: Type in a word, press ENTER and then type "." and ENTER. The server will return your word with all the letters in lowercase.
Example: "HELLO" becomes "hello"

REVERSE: Type in a word, and press ENTER. The server will return your word with all the letters in reverse order.
Example: "George" becomes "egroeG"

EXIT: Exits the program.
