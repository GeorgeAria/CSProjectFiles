# Distributed Asynchronous Distance Vector Routing
In the assignment for my Computer Science Networking course, my team member and I were tasked with simulating a networking environment using the Distance Vector Routing algorithm.
To test the program, we ran the Project.java file and gave it the values 3, 0, and then another number for the random number seed.
