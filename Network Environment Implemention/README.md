# Distributed Asynchronous Distance Vector Routing
In this assignment for my Computer Science Networking course, my team member and I were tasked with simulating a networking environment using the Distance Vector Routing algorithm. This algorithm allows routers to determine the shortest path to a certain destination by generating a table that tells it what that path is.
To test the program, run the Project.java file and gave it the values 3, 0, and then another number for the random number seed.
