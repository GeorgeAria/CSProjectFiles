# Distributed Asynchronous Distance Vector Routing
In this assignment, I and my classmate Kaylee were tasked with simulating a networking environment using the Distance Vector Routing algorithm.
To test the program, you would run the Project.java file and give it the values 3, 0, and then any number for the random number seed.
