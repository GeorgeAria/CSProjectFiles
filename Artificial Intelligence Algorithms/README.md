# CS Algorithm Implementations

The goal of this assignment was to create programs that would implement search algorithms such as Breath First Search and Depth First Search on data structures such as Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix and Object Oriented based data structures. We refer to these data structures in our code as graphs.

To test the graph implementations, you would run the test_graph.py file in the test folder.
To test the search algorithms, you would run the test_algorithm.py file in the test folder.
